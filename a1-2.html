        <p>“These masks represent supernatural beings and were worn by dancers who performed in the winter ceremonies of the Nuxalk (referred to in the hall as the "Bella Coola"). A ceremony lasted four nights and consisted of many songs, dances, and mythological dramas. Each dance was thought to be an imitation of one performed by a supernatural being in the world above.
        
        These masks, which represent supernatural beings, were worn by dancers who performed in the winter ceremonies of the Nuxalk. The masks were carved during the ceremony and burned at its conclusion. The larger masks were carved of beech; and the smaller, of alder. Each sculptor endeavored to make a striking effigy with the result that even Nuxalk with considerable knowledge could not always identify the supernatural being portrayed. The principal masks, however, were sufficiently standardized so that they could always be identified. The masks were painted; sometimes the painting identified the mask when the carving failed to do so.“-American Museum of Natural History on Nuxalk Masks</p></div>

        <p>As described on the Canadian Museum of History's website, "In the narratives told by Aboriginal peoples of the Pacific Coast, supernatural beings take the form of animals, birds or fish in the human world. But in their own villages, these beings live as humans. Many stories tell of the encounters between humans and animal/supernatural beings, and these stories are brought to life in masks and dance. In some cases, the stories and the masks have both been preserved together. In other cases, only the mask remains.
        
        Stories, and the right to tell them, are passed down in families from one generation to another. As the mask that represents the story goes out of use, a new mask may be made to take its place. The story endures."</p>

        <p>RAVEN MASK, Nuxalk, Central Coast, British Columbia ca. 1860–1880</p>
        <p>Raven: "Raven is the culture hero of Bella Coola mythology. He is a revered and benevolent transformer character who helps the people and shapes their world for them, but at the same time, he is also a trickster spirit and many Bella Coola stories about Raven have to do with his frivolous or poorly thought out behavior getting him into trouble." - Native Langauges of the Americas Website</p>
