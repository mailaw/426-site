        "The Nuxalk Nation is a small indigenous community of about 1300 individuals. These people are from various locations within Nuxalk Territory. They amalgamated after the smallpox epidemic in 1862. This territory is also known as Bella Coola Valley, a steep sided valley within the coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem of the central coast of British Columbia. The Nuxalkmc (Nuxalk People) have traditionally depended on a diverse and healthy diet based on salmon, other seafood, root vegetables and greens, wild berries and game from their home territories. Like other small coastal communities, the Nuxalkmc have encountered major economic and social change over the past two hundred years, and they have, as a group, incurred a myriad of health problems related to loss of traditional foods and altered life styles." -nuxalk.net</p>

            <h4>"We, the Nuxalkmc, have always had close ties to our natural environment, to the land and the water. Families have Smayustas, or creation stories, about where we first descended to the earth. These stories have been passed on through countless generations, maintaining the close tie each Nuxalkmc has to the land and origins of each family. Our histories, including our dances, songs, crests, house poles and names tell us who we are, who we continue to be."-nuxalknation.ca in History</h4>

            "Traditionally, the Bella Coola lived in permanent villages of large plank-built houses occupied by a number of families. They used wood for houses, canoes, and watertight boxes that served a variety of domestic purposes. Cedar bark provided fibres for clothing, baskets were made of cedar and spruce, and alder and cedar were carved into masks and other ceremonial objects, including spectacular totem poles. Fish was their basic food source, supplemented by hunting and by collecting wild plant foods. Salmon, taken in the summer, were eaten fresh or smoked; oil extracted from eulachon (candlefish) was used as a condiment. Life was organized on a village basis, with status dependent on both hereditary rank and wealth, measured by ostentatious giving at potlatches. There was no formal political structure connecting Bella Coola communities to one another but rather a strong feeling of shared identity based on common language, common origin, and cultural pride. Secret societies were important, with an unusually well-developed pantheon of deities and great emphasis on numerous oral traditions.

            The Bella Coola probably numbered about 5,000 at the time of their first contacts with Europeans but were reduced by disease in the 19th century to less than 1,000 people, most living in a single village. Bella Coola and other Salish descendants numbered more than 21,000 in the early 21st century." - Britannica on Bella Coola
