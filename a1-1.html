    <h3>The 5 Worlds & House of Myths</h3>

        <p>"The Bella Coola believe that there are five worlds, one above an-other. The middle one is our own world, the earth. Above it are spanned two heavens, while below it there are two underworlds. In the upper heaven resides the supreme deity, a woman who interferes comparatively little with the fates of mankind. In the centre of the lower heaven, that is in the zenith, stands the house of the gods, in which reside the Sun and all the other deities. Our own earth is an island swimming in the ocean. The underworld is inhabited by the ghosts, who are at liberty to return to heaven, whence they may be sent down again to our earth. The ghosts who die a second death sink to the lowest world, from which there is no return. </p>
        <p>The upper heaven is called Atsa'axL, or Snutx•ok•'ills ti SOnx t'ai•, or StinxauL Omq'cimkilik•a. The deity ruling there is a woman who is called Qamatits, or Tsi sisnaant, (" our woman "), or Eku I yak•imtoLs'IL (" afraid of nothing" . This heaven is described as a prairie without any trees. It is said that in order to reach it one must go up the river from the house of the gods in the lower heaven. In another tradition it is said that in travelling from the lower heaven to the upper heaven one has to pass the rent in the sky which is called TsLna'lotas ti SOnx• t'ai•. The house of the supreme deity stands in the far east, and a gale is continually blowing over the open country, driving every thing towards the entrance of her house. Near the house, however, it is calm. In front of the house stands a post in the shape of a large winged monster, and its mouth is the entrance to the house. In front of the house-door there is gravel of three colors,—blue, black, and white. Behind the house is a salt-water pond in which the goddess bathes. In this pond lives the sesiuL or xtsaltsalcisEm. This being sometimes descends to our world. Wherever it moves, the rocks burst, and slide down the sides of the mountains. It is described as a snake or a fish. </p>
    
        <p>In the beginning of the world the mountains were of great height. They were human beings who made the world uninhabitable. Qamā'its made war upon the mountains. She vanquished them, and made them smaller than they used to be. During this fight she broke off the nose of the mountain YūlyulE'mL, which is situated near NuL!E'l! Its face may be recognized even now and the Indians say that when its name is called, it answers. There are two mountains near the head-waters of Bella Coola River. The one is called SLex•ekoai'L ; the other one, Na'axL. The for-mer had a fire, called Snutai'k•nîmsta, burning in his house. This fire warned him of the approach of enemies. When Ctameits made war upon the mountains, the fire warned its master. Ctameits was coming down the river in her canoe, which is named "nun." When she approached, he broke her canoe, and she returned to heaven. The canoe has been trans-formed into stone, and may be seen to this day at the foot of the mountain SLex•têkoai'L. It is said that Qama'its visits the earth every now and then. Her visits cause sickness and death. She is described as a great warrior. In the centre of the lower heaven, which is called Sōnx•, stands the house of the gods. This house is named NusmE'ta (the House of Myths), or Nusk!oaLtnai'x•sta (" where man was created "), or Nusk•LaLnE'msta (" the house from which people come down "), or Nusl!oaLtnai'x•sta (" the house to which people go "). In front of the house stands a post called NuLtnē'k•ta. It is painted with representations of all kinds of birds. A white crane (?), Ctex6x, is sitting on top of the post. The master of the house is SEnx, the Sun. He is also called Ta'ata (" our father"), or Smai'ya-kila (" the sacred one "), or Smayalo'oLla. It seems that he is the only deity to whom the Bella Coola pray. They do not pray to Qama'its, the deity of the supreme heaven. I have not found any prayers directed to the other deities of the, lower heaven.</p>

        <p>The Bella Coola also make offerings to the Sun. Hunters throw four small slices of seal-meat, of mountain-goat tallow, etc., into the fire as an offering to the Sun, in order to obtain success in hunting. Sick people burn parts of their clothing, which they decorate with red cedar-bark, as an offering to regain health. The second deity, who is called ALk'unta'm, seems to be of equal im-portance. SEnx and ALk'unta'm stay in the rear of the House of Myths. Near the fire stays SnoLk'ulx•aqs. He is an old man who formerly ruled over the House of Myths, but who has given up his place in favor of SEnx and ALk'unta'm. These two might be called the rulers of mankind. In most traditions they are described as trying to destroy man, notwithstanding the fact that they are considered the creators of mankind. This peculiar charac-teristic of these deities is clearly brought out in the traditions recorded on pp. 78 ff. In one legend which I collected in 1890, ALk'unta'm's mother, Nunusomik•eeqonEim, is described as a Cannibal, who inserts her long snout in the ears of man, and sucks out his brain. Eventually she was transformed into the mosquito.' I did not hear her mentioned as one of the deities residing in the House of Myths. According to the same tradition, the salmon were obtained by a man who gambled with ALk'unta'm, the stake being the salmon. ALk'unta'm lost, and the man took the salmon down from heaven. Another legend of the origin of the salmon is recorded on p. 38, where it is told how the birds obtained the salmon. According to still another tradition (p. 94), the Raven obtained the salmon by marrying a salmon girl. In the tradition quoted above, ALk'unta'm also gives to man the power to cure disease by means of the water of life, which the shaman sprinkles on the sick person. </p>

            <p>A number of inferior deities live in the House of Myths. They might be called the assistants of the principal deities. In order to understand their functions, it is necessary to state that the deities residing in the House of Myths have particular charge of the religious winter ceremonial of the Bella Coola which is called ku'siut, and which corresponds to the ts'etsa'eqa of the Kwakiutl. I have described this ceremonial, and its importance in the social life of the Kwakiutl, in another paper.2 The ku'siut is of equal importance to an understanding of the social life and mythology of the Bella Coola. It is sufficient to say at this place that the ceremonials per-formed during the ku'siut are mostly dramatic representations of myths referring to the various deities, particularly to those of the House of Myths : therefore masks representing these deities are used in the ceremonials." Refer to the House of Myths section to read more about how masks play an important role in Nuxalk Mythology. </p>
        
        <p>The functions of many of the inferior deities seem to refer solely to the ku'siut. These deities and their functions are as follows : Six•sek•ilai'x• (Plate VII, Fig. 6) ordains the death of man and animals. According to one statement that I received, there are four deities of this name in the House of Myths. It is his particular duty to kill those who transgress the laws of the ku'siut. This deity is men-tioned by Jacobsen, who calls him Sek-seik Kallai 4 Nusne'neq'als (Plate VII, Fig. 7), or the Snene'iq of the House of Myths, sits by himself in one corner of the house. He prevents those who are not initiated in the secrets of the ka'siut from approaching the house. The Snene'iq is a fabulous monster, the peculiarities of which are described in a number of traditions (see pp. 83 ff.). S'anoLx•muLa'lt (Plate VII, Figs. 12 and 13) is a boy who performs ko'siut dances all the time. When the deities resolve to send a new dance down to our world, it is conveyed by S'anoLx•muLagt. It is the office of another deity to sing, accompanying the Ith'siut dances of the gods (Plate VII, Fig. 3). Anuqat'o'tsEm is a deity in regard to whose functions I have not been able to obtain detailed information. It is said that he intervenes on behalf of man when SEnx and ALk'unta'm threaten to punish him. There are two gOddesses in the house who also intervene in favor of man when the principal deities threaten him with death and sickness. Their names are Snitsma'na (Plate VII, Fig. 9) and AiaLila'axa (Plate VII, Figs. to and II). They wake man after sleep. Without their help, nobody could wake from sleep. AiaLila'axa is at the same time the guardian of the moon. Every month she restores the moon to her full size, and she cleans her face after an eclipse. The moon is called A'nL'atg•ila (Plate X, Fig. to). The eclipse is produced by several deities called Aiq'oa'yosnEm, which means " painting the face black " (Plate X, Figs. 4-6). It is believed that at this time the moon performs one of the most sacred ceremonies of the kresiut, which are thought to be very dangerous to the performer. The black paint with which her face is covered is supposed to be a protection against these dangers. AiaLila'axa cleans off the paint after the dance has been completed. According to Jacobsen,' the Indians say that during an eclipse the moon (En-kla-loi'-killa) paints her face black. The same deities are believed to paint and to clean the faces of human ku'siut dancers. Snitsma'na and AiaLila'axa also resuscitate those who are killed by the dangerous performances of the kresiut." -The Mythology of Bella Coola Indians by Franz Boas </p>
